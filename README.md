# Rick and Morty Character Wiki

This mini-project displays a list of Rick and Morty characters, allowing you to filter them by status and search by name. 
## Key Functionalities

- **Filter by Status:** Allows users to filter characters based on their status (e.g., Alive, Dead, Unknown).
- **Search by Name:** Users can search for characters by their names.
- **Pagination:** The character list is paginated, enabling users to navigate through multiple pages of results.
- **Loading Indicator:** A countdown and loading indicator inform users while data is being fetched.

The application uses Vue.js for building the user interface and Axios for fetching data from the Rick and Morty API.
